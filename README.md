- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ElenaMartelo!!!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML and CSS both my myself and at uni and dabbled a bit with javascript and programming logic.
- As future goals, I want to polish my fundamentals, dive deeper in frontend and learn how to code in Elixir and Haskell as a hobby.
